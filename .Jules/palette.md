## 2024-07-16 - Visual Cues for Required Fields

**Learning:** Forms containing inputs that are programmatically required (e.g., using the `required` attribute) but lack a corresponding visual indicator can lead to user confusion and frustration. The absence of a simple asterisk (`*`) or similar cue forces users to guess which fields are mandatory, increasing the cognitive load and potential for submission errors.

**Action:** In future tasks involving form creation or modification, I will ensure that any functionally required field is also visually marked as such directly in the UI, typically by adding a styled asterisk to its corresponding `<label>`. This small addition significantly improves form usability and accessibility.
