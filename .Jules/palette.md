## 2025-02-01 - [Improving Password Visibility for Thai Users]
**Learning:** Adding a password visibility toggle significantly improves UX, especially when combined with localized Thai labels ('แสดงรหัสผ่าน' / 'ซ่อนรหัสผ่าน'). Integrating project-standard fonts (Kanit, Sarabun) and focus-visible states ensures the micro-UX feels native to the application's design system.
**Action:** Always include localization for ARIA labels in Thai when implementing UI components in this repository, and default to Kanit for headings and Sarabun for body text.
